As we continue our efforts on the next major update to Shoko itself, packed with new features and significant
improvements, we're excited to shine a spotlight on a new community Plex agent/scanner recently launched, called
ShokoRelay.

##### What Is ShokoRelay?

ShokoRelay originated as a fork/PR of Shoko Metadata, initially aimed at addressing missing features in the original
software. However, as further adjustments were made, it underwent a transformative process, acquiring its own distinct
functionalities. This development was driven by diverse perspectives on what the plugin should offer, ultimately leading
to the emergence of ShokoRelay.

The primary differentiator between ShokoRelay and Shoko Metadata lies in ShokoRelay's provision of a unified agent and
scanner for Plex. This consolidated tool effectively manages both TV series and movie collections. While it has always
been possible to adapt Shoko Metadata for this purpose, ShokoRelay was designed from the get-go with the
concept of a unified media library in mind. It has been carefully designed to handle the specific challenges that
arise when integrating Plex into a library containing various types of media.

##### So Why Use It?

Although the capabilities of a Plex agent and scanner are inherently limited, ShokoRelay was also designed to work in
tandem with various external scripts to enhance your Plex library further. The package also includes a selection of
optional scripts, offering functionalities such as bulk updating collection posters using either your provided images or
those sourced from Shoko. Additionally, there are scripts to prompt Plex to fetch updated data from Shoko and an
alternative method for syncing watch states.

Both plugins excel in media playback, so the decision ultimately boils down to determining which one best caters to your
needs.

##### Switching From ShokoMetadata

Users can utilize both Plex agents and scanners without any issues, so there is no risk in giving ShokoRelay a try. If
you don't like it, you can always remove it and stick with your ShokoMetadata setup. The important thing to remember is
that, at the end of the day, both plugins are exceptional at what they do, and you're not missing out by using one over
the other.

##### Additional Info and Download

If you're curious, we suggest investing a few moments to read the 
[ShokoRelay README](https://github.com/natyusha/ShokoRelay.bundle) for comprehensive details and a breakdown of 
updates. Download and install instructions are also provided there.

##### Coming Soon

We're aware it's been a while since the last Shoko version update. However, rest assured, we haven't been idle. We've
been actively engaged in significant refactoring and adding new features to bring you an even better Shoko experience.
Stay tuned for more details as we'll soon be sharing our upcoming release plans with you.
